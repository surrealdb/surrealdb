# CodeQL security analysis for Rust
#
# This workflow performs static security analysis using GitHub CodeQL.
# It is configured to:
# - Run on main branch pushes and on a weekly schedule (not on PRs to avoid blocking merges)
# - Use build-mode: none to avoid full Rust compilation (saves significant disk space)
# - Clean up disk space before analysis to prevent out-of-space errors
#
# Results are uploaded to GitHub Security tab but do not block PR merges.
