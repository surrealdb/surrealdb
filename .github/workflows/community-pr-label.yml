# Community PR Labeler
#
# This workflow automatically labels PRs from community contributors (non-core team members).
# It runs when PRs are opened, marked ready for review, reopened, or synchronized.
# PRs in draft mode are skipped.
#
# SECURITY NOTE: This uses pull_request_target (not pull_request) to allow labeling
# forked PRs. This is safe because:
# - We don't check out any code from the PR
# - We only read PR metadata (author) from the GitHub API context
# - The core team list is defined in this workflow file (not user-controlled)
