# CodeQL configuration for SurrealDB
#
# This configuration optimizes CodeQL analysis for Rust by:
# - Excluding test directories to reduce analysis time
# - Excluding generated code and build artifacts
# - Excluding fuzzing and benchmarking code which may contain intentional patterns

name: "SurrealDB CodeQL Config"

# Paths to exclude from analysis
paths-ignore:
  # Test directories
  - "**/tests/**"
  - "**/test/**"
  - "**/benches/**"
  - "language-tests/**"
  - "tests/**"
  - "fuzz/**"
  - "profiling/**"

  # Build artifacts and generated code
  - "target/**"

  # Documentation and images
  - "doc/**"
  - "img/**"

  # Packaging and deployment
  - "pkg/**"
  - "docker/**"

# Use the default query suites plus security-extended for thorough security analysis
