Most of the crate is code to parse and validate the output of `rustc -vV`. The caller can
choose which `rustc` to use, or can use `rustc_version::{version, version_meta}` which will
try `$RUSTC` followed by `rustc`.

If an adversary can arbitrarily set the `$RUSTC` environment variable then this crate will
execute arbitrary code. But when this crate is used within a build script, `$RUSTC` should
be set correctly by `cargo`.
