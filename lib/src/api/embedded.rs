//! Embedded database instance
//!
//! `SurrealDB` itself can be embedded in this library, allowing you to query it using the same
//! crate and API that you would use when connecting to it remotely via WebSockets or HTTP.
//! All [storage engines](crate::api::storage) are supported but you have to activate their feature
//! flags first.
//!
//! **NB**: Some storage engines like `TiKV` and `RocksDB` depend on non-Rust libraries so you need
//! to install those libraries before you can build this crate when you activate their feature
//! flags. Please refer to [these instructions](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/blob/main/doc/BUILDING.md)
//! for more details on how to install them. If you are on Linux and you use
//! [the Nix package manager](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/tree/main/pkg/nix#installing-nix)
//! you can just run
//!
//! ```bash
//! nix develop github:surrealdb/surrealdb
//! ```
//!
//! which will drop you into a shell with all the dependencies available. One tip you may find
//! useful is to only enable the in-memory engine (`kv-mem`) during development. Besides letting you not
//! worry about those dependencies on your dev machine, it allows you to keep compile times low
//! during development while allowing you to test your code fully.
