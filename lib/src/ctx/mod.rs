//! This module defines and handles the `context` for the SurrealDB database.
//! ## Concept
//! The context is shared through the code. To understand the context of `context` we must appreciate that
//! there are different layers to the SurrealDB database. Whilst at this point in time there is no definition
//! of all the layers in code, we can illustrate the layers with the following lifecycle of a database request:
//! - we start with an SQL statement
//! - the SQL statement is then parsed into an operation
//! - we then go down to the key value store . . .
//! Here we can see that the database request is handled by different layers. The `context` is the shared state.
//! Each layer can clone the `context` but it must be noted that the values of the `context` are not cloned. A
//! simple example of using the `context` is to keep track of the duration of the request, or if the process has
//! been cancelled or not.
