<h2><img height="20" src="https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/blob/main/img/whatissurreal.svg?raw=true">&nbsp;&nbsp;What is SurrealDB?</h2>

SurrealDB is an end-to-end cloud native database for web, mobile, serverless, jamstack, backend, and traditional applications. SurrealDB reduces the development time of modern applications by simplifying your database and API stack, removing the need for most server-side components, allowing you to build secure, performant apps quicker and cheaper. SurrealDB acts as both a database and a modern, realtime, collaborative API backend layer. SurrealDB can run as a single server or in a highly-available, highly-scalable distributed mode - with support for SQL querying from client devices, GraphQL, ACID transactions, WebSocket connections, structured and unstructured data, graph querying, full-text indexing, geospatial querying, and row-by-row permissions-based access.

<h2><img height="20" src="https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/blob/main/img/features.svg?raw=true">&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick look</h2>

With strongly-typed data types, data can be fully modelled right in the database.

```sql
UPDATE person SET
	waist = <int> "34.59",
	height = <float> 201,
	score = <decimal> 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.1
;
```

Store dynamically computed fields which are calculated when retrieved.

```sql
CREATE person SET
	birthday = "2007-06-22",
	can_drive = <future> { time::now() > birthday + 18y }
;
```

Easily work with unstructured or structured data, in schema-less or schema-full mode.

```sql
-- Create a schemafull table
DEFINE TABLE user SCHEMAFULL;

-- Specify fields on the user table
DEFINE FIELD name ON TABLE user TYPE object;
DEFINE FIELD name.first ON TABLE user TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD name.last ON TABLE user TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD email ON TABLE user TYPE string ASSERT string::is::email($value);

-- Add a unique index on the email field preventing duplicate values
DEFINE INDEX email ON TABLE user COLUMNS email UNIQUE;

-- Create a new event whenever a user changes their email address
DEFINE EVENT email ON TABLE user WHEN $before.email != $after.email THEN (
	CREATE event SET user = $this, time = time::now(), value = $after.email, action = 'email_changed'
);
```

Connect records together with fully directed graph edge connections.

```sql
-- Add a graph edge between user:tobie and article:surreal
RELATE user:tobie->write->article:surreal
	SET time.written = time::now()
;

-- Add a graph edge between specific users and developers
LET $from = (SELECT users FROM company:surrealdb);
LET $devs = (SELECT * FROM user WHERE tags CONTAINS 'developer');
RELATE $from->like->$devs UNIQUE
	SET time.connected = time::now()
;
```


Query data flexibly with advanced expressions and graph queries.

```sql
-- Select a nested array, and filter based on an attribute
SELECT emails[WHERE active = true] FROM person;

-- Select all 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level people who this specific person record knows, or likes, as separate outputs
SELECT ->knows->(? AS f1)->knows->(? AS f2)->(knows, likes AS e3 WHERE influencer = true)->(? AS f3) FROM person:tobie;

-- Select all person records (and their recipients), who have sent more than 5 emails
SELECT *, ->sent->email->to->person FROM person WHERE count(->sent->email) > 5;

-- Select other products purchased by people who purchased this laptop
SELECT <-purchased<-person->purchased->product FROM product:laptop;

-- Select products purchased by people in the last 3 weeks who have purchased the same products that we purchased
SELECT ->purchased->product<-purchased<-person->(purchased WHERE created_at > time::now() - 3w)->product FROM person:tobie;
```

Store GeoJSON geographical data types, including points, lines and polygons.

```sql
UPDATE city:london SET
	centre = (-0.118092, 51.509865),
	boundary = {
		type: "Polygon",
		coordinates: [[
			[-0.38314819, 51.37692386], [0.1785278, 51.37692386],
			[0.1785278, 51.61460570], [-0.38314819, 51.61460570],
			[-0.38314819, 51.37692386]
		]]
	}
;
```

Write custom embedded logic using JavaScript functions.

```sql
CREATE film SET
	ratings = [
		{ rating: 6, user: user:bt8e39uh1ouhfm8ko8s0 },
		{ rating: 8, user: user:bsilfhu88j04rgs0ga70 },
	],
	featured = function() {
		return this.ratings.filter(r => {
			return r.rating >= 7;
		}).map(r => {
			return { ...r, rating: r.rating * 10 };
		});
	}
;
```

Specify granular access permissions for client and application access.

```sql
-- Specify access permissions for the 'post' table
DEFINE TABLE post SCHEMALESS
	PERMISSIONS
		FOR select
			-- Published posts can be selected
			WHERE published = true
			-- A user can select all their own posts
			OR user = $auth.id
		FOR create, update
			-- A user can create or update their own posts
			WHERE user = $auth.id
		FOR delete
			-- A user can delete their own posts
			WHERE user = $auth.id
			-- Or an admin can delete any posts
			OR $auth.admin = true
;
```
