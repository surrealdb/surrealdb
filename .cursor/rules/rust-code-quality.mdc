# Rust code and quality

## 1. Coding standards
- Prefer workspace-managed dependencies; don't add dependencies without getting confirmation first
- Use `anyhow::Result` for fallible APIs and `thiserror` for domain error enums
- Leverage `ensure!` and `bail!` macros for guard-style validation
- Use `web_time::Instant` and `web_time::SystemTime` instead of `std::time::Instant` / `std::time::SystemTime` for WASM compatibility. `std::time::Duration` is fine to use directly. This is enforced by `cargo make ci-check-imports`

## 2. Async and concurrency
- Keep long-running or blocking work off async tasks; push blocking work to tokios blocking threadpool or `affinitypool` when needed
- Maintain `#[cfg_attr]` patterns for WASM compatibility (e.g., `async_trait(?Send)`)
- Avoid spawning background tasks without cancellation paths; tie task lifetime to owners

## 3. Tracing and logging
- Instrument public async functions with the `#[instrument(...)]` macro
- Never log sensitive user data or credentials; scrub values before tracing

## 4. Error handling
- Propagate datastore errors via project error types (e.g., `crate::err::Error`) before wrapping in `anyhow`
- Never use `.unwrap_or_default()` or similar coding conventions when debugging - it masks errors

## 5. Testing and linting
- Run `cargo make fmt` to format all of the code before submitting changes
- Run `cargo make ci-clippy` and address warnings; do not suppress lints without justification
- Add language tests or SDK tests alongside bug fixes where applicable
- Add tests according to the project testing conventions

## 6. Performance and memory
- Guard recursion depth by using helper runtimes with increased stack size when necessary
- Avoid unnecessary allocations; prefer `clone` minimisation patterns enforced by Clippy
- This is a database: performance matters, and any change must consider the impact which it has
- Think thoroughly about performance of code changes before making suggestions or altering code
