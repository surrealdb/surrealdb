# GitHub issues and bugs

**NEVER assume bug reports are correct without verification. Always follow this process:**

## 1. Verify expected behavior first
- Read the issue description completely and think about the submitted issue
- Check existing language tests in `language-tests/tests/` that relate to the reported functionality
- If related to or referencing SurrealQL, look for relevant test cases in `.surql` files
- If related to the Rust SDK, the API, or the network interface, check tests in `surrealdb/tests/` and `tests/` for similar usage patterns
- Search for similar functionality patterns in the codebase to understand intended behavior
- Consult SurrealQL documentation at https://surrealdb.com/docs or existing examples before assuming something is broken

## 2. Reproduce and analyze
- Create minimal test cases to reproduce the reported issue
- Test the behavior described in the bug report using the language-tests framework
- Compare actual results with SurrealQL language specifications
- Look for edge cases or misunderstandings in the user's expectations
- Ensure the user's code is not badly written, and could be causing the bug

## 3. Investigate before implementing
- Search for existing tests that validate the reported "broken" behavior
- Check if the behavior is actually documented/intended functionality
- Look for recent changes that might have altered expected behavior
- Consider whether this is a core database issue, SDK problem, or user error
- Ensure code is well written, and doesn't hide or ignore any returned errors

## 4. Create reproduction test (for SurrealQL/core issues)
- If the issue involves SurrealQL queries or core database functionality, create a reproduction test file, regardless of whether it is a bug or not
- Create file: `language-tests/tests/reproductions/ISSUENUMBER_short_summary.surql`
- Follow the format specified in `language-tests/README.md`:
  - Use test comments with TOML configuration (`/**` or `//!`)
  - You can use the `--results accept` arguments to automatically generate the database output
  - Include `[test]` section with `reason` and `issue` number
  - Include `[env]` section with appropriate namespace/database settings if relevant
  - Add `[[test.results]]` sections for expected outcomes (if not automatically generated)
  - Write the actual SurrealQL queries to reproduce the issue

## 5. Response protocol
- Start by verifying if this is actually unexpected behavior
- Investigate existing tests and documentation before proposing solutions
- Only proceed with fixes after confirming the behavior is incorrect

**Remember: Issues may stem from various sources including usage patterns, SDK integration, deserialization, or actual bugs. Always verify the root cause before implementing fixes.**
