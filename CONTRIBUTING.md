# Contributing

We would &nbsp;<img width="15" src="./img/love.svg">&nbsp; for you to contribute to SurrealDB and help make it better! We want contributing to SurrealDB to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone and everyone. All contributions are welcome, including features, bugfixes, and documentation changes, as well as updates and tweaks, blog posts, workshops, and everything else.

## How to start

If you are worried or donâ€™t know where to start, check out our next section explaining what kind of help we could use and where can you get involved. You can ask us a question on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/discussions), or the [SurrealDB Discord Server](https://surrealdb.com/discord). Alternatively, you can message us on any channel in the [SurrealDB Community](https://surrealdb.com/community)!

## Code of conduct

Help us keep SurrealDB open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Coding standards

SurrealDB uses [`rustfmt`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) to ensure that all code is formatted to the same standards. To install `rustfmt` run the following code:

```bash
rustup component add rustfmt
```

## Getting started from the source

To set up a working **development environment**, you can either [use the Nix package manager](pkg/nix#readme) or you can [install dependencies manually](doc/BUILDING.md#building-surrealdb) and ensure that you have `rustup` installed, and fork the project git repository.

> Please note that these instructions are for setting up a functional dev environment. If you just want to install SurrealDB for day-to-day usage and not as a code maintainer use this [installation guide](https://surrealdb.com/docs/install). If you want to get started integrating SurrealDB into your app, view the [integration tutorials](https://surrealdb.com/docs/integration).

```bash
# Use the default (stable) release channel if prompted
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
git clone git@github.com:[YOUR_FORK_HERE]/surrealdb.git
cd surrealdb
cargo run -- help
```

To run the SurrealDB database server, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --no-default-features --features storage-mem,http,scripting -- start --log trace --user root --pass root memory
```

To listen to code changes as you develop, use the following command:

```bash
cargo watch -x 'run --no-default-features --features storage-mem,http,scripting -- start --log trace --user root --pass root memory'
```

SurrealDB runs by default on port 8000. To change the default port, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --no-default-features --features storage-mem,http,scripting -- start --log trace --user root --pass root --bind 0.0.0.0:9000 memory
```

To run all tests manually, use the SurrealDB command-line from your terminal:

```bash
cargo test
```

To build a production-ready SurrealDB binary, execute the following command:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Scalability and Performance

SurrealDB is designed to be fast and to scale. It is built to work in both a single-node setup and as a distributed cluster. In distributed mode, SurrealDB builds upon [TiKV](https://tikv.org). Please keep in mind that SurrealDB is designed to be run in different environments, with different configurations, and at differing scales.

When contributing code, please take into account the following considerations:

- SurrealDB startup time
- Query execution time
- Query response times
- Query throughput
- Requests per second
- Websocket connections
- Network usage
- Memory usage

## Security and Privacy

We take the security of SurrealDB code, software, and cloud platform very seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in SurrealDB, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

Please report any issues or vulnerabilities to security@surrealdb.com, instead of posting a public issue in GitHub. Please include the SurrealDB version identifier, by running `surreal version` on the command-line, and details on how the vulnerability can be exploited.

When developing, make sure to follow the best industry standards and practices.

## External dependencies

Please avoid introducing new dependencies to SurrealDB without consulting the team. New dependencies can be very helpful but also introduce new security and privacy issues, complexity, and impact total docker image size. Adding a new dependency should have vital value on the product with minimum possible risk.

## Introducing new features

We would &nbsp;<img width="15" alt="Love" src="https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/blob/main/img/love.svg?raw=true">&nbsp; for you to contribute to SurrealDB, but we would also like to make sure SurrealDB is as great as possible and loyal to its vision and mission statement. For us to find the right balance, please open a question on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/discussions) with any ideas before creating a [**GitHub Issue**](/issues). This will allow the SurrealDB community to have sufficient discussion about the new feature value and how it fits in the product roadmap and vision, before introducing a new pull request

This is also important for the SurrealDB lead developers to be able to give technical input and different emphasis regarding the feature design and architecture. Some bigger features might need to go through our [RFC process](https://github.com/surrealdb/rfcs).


## Submitting a pull request

The **branch name** is your first opportunity to give your task context.
Branch naming convention is as follows 

`TYPE-ISSUE_ID-DESCRIPTION`

It is recommended to combine the relevant [**GitHub Issue**](/issues) with a short description that describes the task resolved in this branch. If you don't have GitHub issue for your PR, then you may avoid the prefix, but keep in mind that more likely you have to create the issue first. For example:
```
bugfix-548-ensure-queries-execute-sequentially
```

Where `TYPE` can be one of the following:

- **refactor** - code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **feature** - code changes that add a new feature
- **bugfix** - code changes that fix a bug
- **docs** - documentation only changes
- **ci** - changes related to CI system

### Commit your changes

- Write a descriptive **summary**: The first line of your commit message should be a concise summary of the changes you are making. It should be no more than 50 characters and should describe the change in a way that is easy to understand.

- Provide more **details** in the body: The body of the commit message should provide more details about the changes you are making. Explain the problem you are solving, the changes you are making, and the reasoning behind those changes.

- Use the **commit history** in your favour: Small and self-contained commits allow the reviewer to see exactly how you solved the problem. By reading the commit history of the PR, the reviewer can already understand what they'll be reviewing, even before seeing a single line of code.

### Create a pull request

- The **title** of your pull request should be clear and descriptive. It should summarize the changes you are making in a concise manner.

- Provide a detailed **description** of the changes you are making. Explain the reasoning behind the changes, the problem it solves, and the impact it may have on the codebase. Keep in mind that a reviewer was not working on your task, so you should explain why you wrote the code the way you did.

- Describe the scene and provide everything that will help to understand the background and a context for the reviewers by adding related GitHub issues to the description, and links to the related PRs, projects or third-party documentation. If there are any potential drawbacks or trade-offs to your changes, be sure to mention them too.

- Be sure to **request reviews** from the appropriate people. This might include the project maintainers, other contributors, or anyone else who is familiar with the codebase and can provide valuable feedback. You can also join our [Weekly Developer Office Hours](https://github.com/orgs/surrealdb/discussions/2118) to chat with the maintainers who will review your code! 

### Getting a better review

- [**Draft pull requests**](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) allow you to create a pull request that is still a work in progress and not ready for review. This is useful when you want to share your changes with others but aren't quite ready to merge them or request immediate feedback.    
https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/

- Once your pull request has been reviewed, be sure to **respond** to any feedback you receive. This might involve making additional changes to your code, addressing questions or concerns, or simply thanking reviewers for their feedback.  

- By using the [**re-request review** feature](https://github.blog/changelog/2019-02-21-re-request-review-on-a-pull-request/), you can prompt the reviewer to take another look at your changes and provide feedback if necessary.  

- The [**CODEOWNERS** file](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS) in GitHub allows you to specify who is responsible for code in a specific part of your repository. You can use this file to automatically assign pull requests to the appropriate people or teams and to ensure that the right people are notified when changes are made to certain files or directories.  

### Finalize the change

- We are actively using **threads** to allow for more detailed and targeted discussions about specific parts of the pull request. A resolved thread means that the conversation has been addressed and the issue has been resolved. Reviewers are responsible for resolving the comment and not the author. The author can simply add a reply comment that the change has been done or decline a request.

- When your pull request is approved, our team will be sure to **merge it responsibly**. This might involve running additional tests or checks, ensuring that the codebase is still functional.

### Summary

To summarize, fork the project and use the `git clone` command to download the repository to your computer. A standard procedure for working on an issue would be to:

1. Clone the `surrealdb` repository and download it to your computer.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb
    ```

    (Optional): Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install) to run the checks before each commit and run:

    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

2. Pull all changes from the upstream `main` branch, before creating a new branch - to ensure that your `main` branch is up-to-date with the latest changes:
    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

3. Create a new branch from `main` like: `bugfix-548-ensure-queries-execute-sequentially`:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b "[the name of your branch]"
    ```

4. Make changes to the code, and ensure all code changes are formatted correctly:
    ```bash
    cargo fmt
    ```

5. Commit your changes when finished:
    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m "[your commit message]"
    ```

6. Push changes to GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin "[the name of your branch]"
    ```

7. Submit your changes for review, by going to your repository on GitHub and clicking the `Compare & pull request` button.

8. Ensure that you have entered a commit message which details the changes, and what the pull request is for.

9. Now submit the pull request by clicking the `Create pull request` button.

10. Wait for code review and approval.

11. After approval, merge your pull request.
