# Upgrading SurrealDB

This document records per-release operational notes for SurrealDB
administrators: wire-format rotations, removed features, configuration
changes, and other impacts that aren't apparent from version numbers
alone. Read this before deploying a new release onto an existing
database.

For the release **process** (how releases are cut and shipped), see
[`RELEASING.md`](./RELEASING.md). For end-user release notes, see
<https://surrealdb.com/releases>.

## v3.1.0 — rev-2 on-disk wire format for `Value`, `Array`, `Object`, `Set`

**Impact**: irreversible on-disk format rotation for every row that
contains a `Value`, `Array`, `Object`, or `Set`.

**Important**: once a v3.1.0+ binary writes a row of any of these types,
the bytes are in the new `revision(2, optimised)` format. A pre-v3.1.0
binary cannot read them. **Binary downgrade is one-way** for any
database the new build has touched, even with no other schema change.
The runtime `MajorVersion` guard
([`surrealdb/core/src/kvs/ds.rs::check_version`](../surrealdb/core/src/kvs/ds.rs))
does **not** catch this — the rotation happens inside the existing
major version, so an older binary opening a v3.1.0-written database
will see the expected `MajorVersion` and then fail at the per-row
`deserialize_revisioned` step when it encounters the unrecognised
rev-2 envelope.

What still works:

- Reading existing rev-1 rows under v3.1.0+ (forward migration is
  fully supported; the multi-revision walker handles both encodings
  transparently).
- All SurrealQL semantics — no query-level behaviour change.
- Replication and failover between v3.1.0+ nodes.

What doesn't:

- Restoring a backup taken from v3.1.0+ onto a pre-v3.1.0 binary.
- Failover from v3.1.0+ data to a pre-v3.1.0 node in a mixed cluster.
- Re-mounting a v3.1.0+ on-disk store with a pre-v3.1.0 build.

If you need the option to roll back, take and verify a logical backup
(`surreal export`) **before** running v3.1.0+ against the live data —
that backup is plain SurrealQL and can be replayed onto any binary
that supports its statements.

See the rationale block at the top of the `Value` enum in
[`surrealdb/core/src/val/mod.rs`](../surrealdb/core/src/val/mod.rs) for
the implementation-side explanation, and `doc/UPGRADING.md` will gain
a new section per future release that introduces another operational
impact of this kind.
