// A versionstamp oracle is a source of truth for the current versionstamp of the database.

// and the performance of the versionstamp generation.

	// SysTimeCounter versionstamp oracle is a HLC based on system time in seconds as the physical time and the
	// in-memory counter that resets every second as the logical time.
	//
	// This is supposed to be only used for one-node installation and is not suitable for multi-node
	// installation of the database.
	//
	// There are two cases this oracle can be not monotonic.
	//
	// First, it can be not monotonic if the system time is not monotonic,
	// because this module does nothing to prevent the system clock from going backwards,
	// and there's no additional mechanism to detect and handle the clock going backwards.
	//
	// Second, it can be not monotonic if the database is restarted within a second,
	// because the in-memory counter resets to 0 on restart and the physical time uses the glanularity
	// of seconds.
	//
	// Do also note that the produced versionstamp's monotonicity needs to be guaranteed
	// by the caller of the oracle too.
	// For example, if it is going to be used as the commit versionstamp of a transaction,
	// the caller needs to ensure that the commit versionstamp is always increasing.
	// Otherwise, the transaction might be committed with a versionstamp that is smaller than
	// the versionstamp of a previous transaction.
	// This is because the versionstamp oracle does not know the context of the versionstamp
	// and cannot guarantee the monotonicity of the versionstamp by itself.
	// Implementation-wise, this can imply that the database needs to ensure that the only one
	// transaction is executing and committing at a time.

	// and the in-memory counter for the second logical time.
	//
	// The epoch is supposed to be persisted in the underlying KVS and increased by one on each database restart.
	// The in-memory counter resets on each database restart and increased by one on each now() call.
	//
	// EpochCounter is designed to be used instead of the SysTimeCounter when the runtime environment
	// does not provide a monotonic system clock, and the database is running in a single-node mode.
