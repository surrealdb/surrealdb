/// When you run CPU-intensive (or otherwise blocking) tasks on the main Tokio runtime or its worker threads,
/// you risk blocking those threads. Because Tokio uses an asynchronous runtime,
/// having a long-running, CPU-bound task can prevent other operations (including I/O-bound operations)
/// from proceeding smoothly. By offloading CPU-intensive tasks to a separate executor in its own thread,
/// your main Tokio event loop remains free to handle other futures and I/O tasks.
