/// Composer for the community edition of SurrealDB.
///
/// This struct implements the composer pattern for dependency injection, providing
/// default implementations of the traits required to initialize and run SurrealDB.
///
/// # Implemented Traits
/// - `TransactionBuilderFactory` - Selects and validates the datastore backend
/// - `RouterFactory` - Constructs the HTTP router with standard routes
/// - `ConfigCheck` - Validates configuration before initialization
///
/// # Usage
/// This is the default composer used by the `surreal` binary. Embedders can create
/// their own composer structs implementing these traits to customize behavior.
///
/// # Example
/// ```ignore
/// use surrealdb_core::CommunityComposer;
///
/// // Pass the composer to init functions
/// surreal::init(CommunityComposer())
/// ```
pub struct CommunityComposer();
