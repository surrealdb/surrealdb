# SurrealDB Core

This crate is the internal core library of SurrealDB.
It contains most of the database functionality on top of which the surreal binary is
implemented. This crate should not be used outside of SurrealDB itself. 
For a stable interface to the SurrealDB library see [the Rust SDK](https://crates.io/crates/surrealdb)
