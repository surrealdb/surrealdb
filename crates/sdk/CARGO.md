<h2><img height="20" src="https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/blob/main/img/features.svg?raw=true">&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick look</h2>

With strongly-typed data types, data can be fully modelled right in the database.

```sql
UPDATE person SET
	waist = <int> "34.59",
	height = <float> 201,
	score = <decimal> 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.1
;
```

Easily work with unstructured or structured data, in schema-less or schema-full mode.

```sql
-- Create a schemafull table
DEFINE TABLE user SCHEMAFULL;

-- Specify fields on the user table
DEFINE FIELD name ON TABLE user TYPE object;
DEFINE FIELD name.first ON TABLE user TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD name.last ON TABLE user TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD email ON TABLE user TYPE string ASSERT string::is::email($value);

-- Add a unique index on the email field preventing duplicate values
DEFINE INDEX email ON TABLE user COLUMNS email UNIQUE;

-- Create a new event whenever a user changes their email address
DEFINE EVENT email ON TABLE user WHEN $before.email != $after.email THEN (
	CREATE event SET user = $this, time = time::now(), value = $after.email, action = 'email_changed'
);
```

Connect records together with fully directed graph edge connections.

```sql
-- Add a graph edge between user:tobie and article:surreal
RELATE user:tobie->write->article:surreal
	SET time.written = time::now()
;

-- Add a graph edge between specific users and developers
LET $from = (SELECT users FROM company:surrealdb);
LET $devs = (SELECT * FROM user WHERE tags CONTAINS 'developer');
RELATE $from->like->$devs UNIQUE
	SET time.connected = time::now()
;
```

Query data flexibly with advanced expressions and graph queries.

```sql
-- Select a nested array, and filter based on an attribute
SELECT emails[WHERE active = true] FROM person;

-- Select all 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level people who this specific person record knows, or likes, as separate outputs
SELECT ->knows->(? AS f1)->knows->(? AS f2)->(knows, likes AS e3 WHERE influencer = true)->(? AS f3) FROM person:tobie;

-- Select all person records (and their recipients), who have sent more than 5 emails
SELECT *, ->sent->email->to->person FROM person WHERE count(->sent->email) > 5;

-- Select other products purchased by people who purchased this laptop
SELECT <-purchased<-person->purchased->product FROM product:laptop;

-- Select products purchased by people in the last 3 weeks who have purchased the same products that we purchased
SELECT ->purchased->product<-purchased<-person->(purchased WHERE created_at > time::now() - 3w)->product FROM person:tobie;
```

Store GeoJSON geographical data types, including points, lines and polygons.

```sql
UPDATE city:london SET
	centre = (-0.118092, 51.509865),
	boundary = {
		type: "Polygon",
		coordinates: [[
			[-0.38314819, 51.37692386], [0.1785278, 51.37692386],
			[0.1785278, 51.61460570], [-0.38314819, 51.61460570],
			[-0.38314819, 51.37692386]
		]]
	}
;
```

Write custom embedded logic using JavaScript functions.

```sql
CREATE film SET
	ratings = [
		{ rating: 6, user: user:bt8e39uh1ouhfm8ko8s0 },
		{ rating: 8, user: user:bsilfhu88j04rgs0ga70 },
	],
	featured = function() {
		return this.ratings.filter(r => {
			return r.rating >= 7;
		}).map(r => {
			return { ...r, rating: r.rating * 10 };
		});
	}
;
```

Specify granular access permissions for client and application access.

```sql
-- Specify access permissions for the 'post' table
DEFINE TABLE post SCHEMALESS
	PERMISSIONS
		FOR select
			-- Published posts can be selected
			WHERE published = true
			-- A user can select all their own posts
			OR user = $auth.id
		FOR create, update
			-- A user can create or update their own posts
			WHERE user = $auth.id
		FOR delete
			-- A user can delete their own posts
			WHERE user = $auth.id
			-- Or an admin can delete any posts
			OR $auth.admin = true
;
```
