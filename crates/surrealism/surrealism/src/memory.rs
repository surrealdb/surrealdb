/// allocator to reserve memory and returns a pointer offset as a `u32`.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `len`: The size of the memory block to allocate, in bytes.
///
/// # Returns
/// A `u32` representing the starting offset (pointer) of the allocated memory.
/// Returns `0` if allocation fails (e.g., out-of-memory condition).
///
/// # Panics
/// Panics if the provided size and alignment do not form a valid `Layout` (e.g., alignment
/// is not a power of two or size overflows when padded).
///
/// # Safety
/// This function is unsafe because it performs raw allocation, and the caller must ensure
/// proper deallocation using `__sr_free` to avoid memory leaks. The returned pointer must
/// be valid for the WASM linear memory context if used in such environments.

/// # Parameters
/// - `ptr`: The starting offset (pointer) of the memory block to deallocate.

///
/// # Safety
/// This function is unsafe because it performs raw deallocation. The caller must ensure:
/// - The `ptr` is a valid pointer previously returned by `__sr_alloc`.
/// - The `len` matches the originally allocated size.
/// - No further access to the memory occurs after deallocation. Incorrect usage may lead to
///   undefined behavior, such as double-free or use-after-free.
